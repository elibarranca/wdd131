			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>New Students come to the city of Rexburg every 4 months to start their studies at BYUI, and they have many tools at their disposal to learn their way in the University, but there is no similar tool that will teach them about their city and the resources taht are available to them, so I decided to solve this by creating a simple New Student Guide to the beautiful city of Rexburg!</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>All the students at Brigham Young University, but specially Freshman.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>Arrays of the different elements in my website, a form where the user can ask for more information and send their email to be contacted, Events so when the user clicks on a button to show an image it will open a bigger image and a link to a map, Functions to have a responsive menu, and Sorting for the elements that the user wants to see</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>
			<!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
			Palette URL:

						<th>Accent 2</th>
                        <th>Accent 3</th>

			<h3>Typography</h3>
